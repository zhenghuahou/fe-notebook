    The difference between width:auto and width:100%
    When adapting a layout for different viewport widths (a.k.a. responsive design) or media (like print), it’s common
    to reset any float and width values on major layout blocks to linearise their display.

    Unfloating a floated element is as simple as specifying float:none. Width doesn’t seem to be quite as
    straightforward – lately I’ve come across several cases where people use width:100% to undo explicitly specified
    widths when they should be using width:auto instead. So here’s a brief explanation of the difference.

    The initial width of a block level element like div or p is auto. This makes it expand to occupy all available
    horizontal space within its containing block. If it has any horizontal padding or border, the widths of those do not
    add to the total width of the element. Here’s the CSS 2.1 specification’s formula for block-level, non-replaced
    elements in normal flow:

    'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' +
    'margin-right' = width of containing block

    As long as the value of width is auto, the element can have horizontal margin, padding and border without becoming
    wider than its container (unless of course the sum of margin-left + border-left-width + padding-left + padding-right
    + border-right-width + margin-right is larger than the container). The width of its content box will be whatever is
    left when the margin, padding and border have been subtracted from the container’s width.

    On the other hand, if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus
    any horizontal margin, padding and border (unless you’ve used box-sizing:border-box, in which case only margins are
    added to the 100% to change how its total width is calculated). This may be what you want, but most likely it isn’t.

    To visualise the difference I made an example: width:auto vs. width:100%.

    So, next time you find yourself setting the width of a block level element to 100% to make it occupy all available
    width, consider if what you really want is setting it to auto. In most cases it is, and doing so will save you from
    wondering why the element doesn’t fit inside its container when you give it a horizontal padding or border later on.

    <p>
        也就是说 width:auto是 width of containing block - margin - border - padding计算出来的，如果计算出的宽度小于0，那么最终width值为0<br/>
        width:100%值就是the containing block's width的值 (没有设置 box-sizing: border-box的情况下)

    <div class="test">
        <div class="a">
            1.-- width: 100%;
        </div>
        <div class="b">
            2.-- width: auto;
        </div>
    </div>
